# Pong

## This is a replica from the classic pong game for computer browsers

The idea to make pong in javascript came to me when I was going through a python course with CMU and we were given the option to make bonus projects.

The course mainly focused on using shapes to learn programming fundamentals such as loops and functions.

I easily recreated pong in 10 minutes with the package we were using and thought that I could do it easily in Javascript.

I was wrong. this project took me about 5 hours to complete, but I am proud to finish it to create my first multiplayer game in Javascript.
